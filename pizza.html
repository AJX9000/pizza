    <h1>The Wonders of Sour Fruit on Savory Cheese</h1>
    <h2>My Favorite Toppings</h2>
    <ol>Pineapple</ol> <!-- ordered list of my favorite toppings-->
    <ol>Extra Cheese</ol>
    <ol>Meatballs</ol>
    <ol>Chicken</ol>
    <ol>Pepperoni</ol>
    <p>In case you couldn't tell from the main heading of this page, my favorite topping is
    pineapple. It's honestly wondrous that pizza's biggest contradiction - a sweet and particularly sour
    fruit - would actually be one of the biggest compliments to the salty and savory dish. At first, I was skeptical of the taste,
    but thanks to good peer pressure, I take pineapple on pizza at any opportunity.</p>

    <h2>Pizzas I Like</h2>
    <ul>Hawaiian Pizza</ul> <!-- unordered list of certain pizzas I like-->
    <ul>Three Cheese Pizza</ul>
    <ul>Supreme Pizza</ul>
    <ul>Pepperoni Pizza</ul>
    <ul>Meatball and Sausage Pizza</ul>
    <p>As if pineapple wasn't enough, ham (sometimes called Canadian bacon) ends up being the final ingredient to
    my favorite pizza. I usually don't care about ham on pizza, though the tropical fruit of sin says otherwise. Also,
    Hawaiian pizza is not Hawaiian; it was invented by a Canadian immigrant named Sam Panopoulos. Sadly, he passed away in 2017, but
    he left quite a legacy, alright. Thanks, internet.</p>
